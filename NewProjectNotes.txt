A few notes for the startup of a new project.

1. create a new virtual env with: python3 -m venv env

2. getting into environment: source env/bin/activate

3. installing dependencies, some needed right away, some not: pip install -r requirements.txt
    - creating the file is done via: pip freeze > requirements.txt

4. create a .gitignore file if necessary.

5. Review the database init process
